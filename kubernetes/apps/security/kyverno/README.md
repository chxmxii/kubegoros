## About

[Kyverno](https://kyverno.io) is a Kubernetes Native Policy Management engine.

It allows you to:
- Manage policies as Kubernetes resources (no new language required.)
- Validate, mutate, and generate resource configurations.
- Select resources based on labels and wildcards.
- View policy enforcement as events.
- Scan existing resources for violations.

This chart bootstraps a Kyverno deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.
